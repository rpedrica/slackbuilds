Avidemux is a free video editor designed for simple cutting, filtering and 
encoding tasks. It supports many file types, including AVI, DVD compatible 
MPEG files, MP4 and ASF, using a variety of codecs. Tasks can be automated 
using projects, job queue and powerful scripting capabilities.

The script supports the following switches:
GTK=yes (default: no) to build the gtk version
QT4=no (default: yes) to avoid building the qt version
CLI=no (default: yes) to avoid building the cli version

Optional dependencies are aften, amrnb, and jack-audio-connection-kit.
