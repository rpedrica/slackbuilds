lxsession (LXDE session manager)

LXSession is the standard session manager used by LXDE (Lightweight X11
Desktop Environment).  A session manager is used to automatically start
a set of applications and set up a working desktop environment.

Pass the switch QT=yes if you are building this for use with LXDE-Qt:
the resulting package won't be usable with the gtk version
(and vice-versa).
