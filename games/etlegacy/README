Wolfenstein Enemy Territory : Legacy is a project that aims
to create a fully compatible client and server for the popular
online FPS game Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.

This script builds the client and the server with omni-bot
support ( http://www.omni-bot.com/ ).

This command line switches are available:
- FREETYPE=yes (default: no) enables freetype support;
- OPENAL=yes (default: no) enables OpenAL support
  (for this you need the optional dependency OpenAL)
- VORBIS=yes (default: no) enables vorbis support
  (for game samples - any around yet);

To play you need also the data files from the original game
(etlegacy-data).

* WARNING *

To have a client/server compatible with the existing
client/servers, build it on/for a 32bit platform.
